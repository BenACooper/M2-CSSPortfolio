# M2-CSSPortfolio
Module 2 challenge for advanced CSS.

This is a starter portfolio. It includes mainly a working navbar, responsive design for different types of viewports, and images that work as stylish links to deployed applications. Currently only "M1 Challenge" is deployed so the other images use placeholder links.
