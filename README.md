Module 2 challenge for advanced CSS.

This is a starter portfolio. It incudes mainly a working navbar, responsive design for different types of viewports, and images that work as stylish links to deployed applications. Currently only "M1 Challenge" and "Pre Work" are deployeed so the other images use placeholder links.
